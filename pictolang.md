# Pictolang v2.19-ALFA

## Goals

1. Develop a semi-formal unicode emoji based language for compressed storage of chats to be reused by AI in later conversations and by humans, initially for entertainment purposes.
2. (tentative) If we get serious in the future, get more formal and develop an algebra of word meanings.
3. (tentative) Express pictolang specs in pictolang itself as milestone proof to test internal expressive power, consistency and predictability when translating formal texts. We could consider division in modulus, like:
    - pictolang_core: tiny, self-expressive layer that can define its own syntax, types, constraints, and modules, to state the rules of Pictolang in Pictolang
    - pictolang_everyday: domain lexicons (house, tree, person…), plus idioms, style guides, and optional macros for ergonomic daily use without touching foundations


### Files

- **pictolang.md**: these specs 
- **gen_pdp.py**: Takes as input the whole file `pictolang.md` and generates the file `pdp.md`.  
- `pdp.md`: Contains the Pictolang Decoding Prompt (PDP). Deterministically generated by `gen_pdp.py`. 
- `pictolang-test.md`: separate file to test encoding / decoding of phrases. 
- `pictolang-dev.md`: non authoritative file just for drafting ideas. 
- For context and comparison purposes, the previous iteration of each file (even deterministically generated like `pdp.md`) will be also stored in a chat of the same name under the same ChatGPT project named "Pictolang".


## Desiderata

- Target human users after reading these rules MUST be able to interpret a string in Pictolang on recent desktop or mobile (must be able to see the symbols). 
- Ideally, the specs SHOULD lead to a language so self crystal clear that a target AI could in principle derive its rules just from very few meaningful examples even without reading the PDP. In the best possible scenario, a sufficiently long string on a random topic without the PDP should be sufficient for the AI to understand most rules and interpret the meaning of most unicode symbols
- For simplicity, Pictolang MUST be modeled after English. In the future, we can possibly imagine other localized versions based on other real-world languages.
- For simplicity, Pictolang MUST be co-designed and tested with ChatGPT5 so to improve likelyness of correct encoding/decoding.  
- Produced text SHOULD fit well in Markdown / Python files.  


## General principles

- **Minimal, visual, intuitive**: chosen symbols should be recognizable at a glance. Prefer visually simple symbols; avoid sequences that are hard to distinguish at small sizes.
- **Literal-by-default**: If a Unicode character's official English name matches the concept, prefer it. As an exception: high-frequency function words (auxiliaries, modals, determiners, pronouns, logical/relational operators) may use abstract symbols from math/operators/arrows/geometric blocks without special marking.
- **Ambiguity avoidance.** Do not assign the same symbol to two active lexemes. If a symbol's Unicode name collides with a different lexeme already in the spec, pick another symbol.
- **Word order**: Follow standard English order. No reordering for logic/maths.
- Determiners: In `setting=natural` context, symbols for determiners (a/an, any, the, etc.) must appear wherever English requires them; in `setting=formal` omitting them is allowed.
- **Questions**: Keep English order; only wh-symbols and final ? mark it.
- **Authority and versioning.**: This lexicon is authoritative over Unicode names and prior Pictolang releases. Any change to mappings requires a version bump and a changelog entry.

### Interpretation

Pictolang defines a reproducible symbol format, not a deterministic grammar. 
Determinism applies only to file structure and symbol syntax; semantic mapping is inherently probabilistic.

We define two functions:

`encode(nl : str) -> str`

- Translates a natural language string to a pictolang symbols string
- Decoders may yield several plausible readings. Contextual or statistical inference is permitted.
- nl MAY also contain pictolang sequences (could be translated verbatim or modified depending on context, see next section).

`decode(pictolang : str) -> str`

- Translates pictolang symbols to a natural language string 
- Multiple valid symbolizations may represent the same English text. 
Encoders choose among equivalent mappings; no canonical output is required.

- encode / decode are non-deterministic, AI and context dependent 
- **AI**: To improve predictability, assume ChatGPT5 is used for both.
- **Literal preference**: When uncertain, encoders and decoders should prefer the most literal English order and sense.
- **Ambiguity**: Lexical or structural ambiguities parallel to English (e.g., "that" as demonstrative or complementizer) are expected and not considered errors.
- **Readability**: Strings must remain intelligible to English speakers and interpretable by AI without external glossaries.

### Context

We define several variables that influence the interpretation: `parsing_mode`, `setting`, `reducer`, `response`, `explanation`. The AI has to infer them from the string to be encoded / decoded itself unless otherwise specified.

**parsing_mode**

`strict`: reject if string doesn't follow the specs,  explain the reason. 

Example: `(1 pluss21)`  ->

```
rejected, in strict mode we don't allow ambiguous / unparseable terms such as "pluss21"
```

`best_effort` [DEFAULT]: parse as the AI usually behaves in regular chats according to system user preferences. Tolerate mispellings, offer interpretations. 

Example: `one⏧ + (2 multiplyed by 5 ⏧` -> 

```
I interpreted this as:

⏧ + (2 * 5⏧) 

a. Perhaps you want me to reduce to 11⏧ ? 

b. ⏧ symbol is not common, would you like me to find similar more standard ones or provide me the intended meaning for a better result? 
```

**setting**

`formal`: math or specs oriented language. 

Example: "Let p_n be a Person. There exists a party with m p_1,p_2 couples."  

`natural` [DEFAULT]: eveything else.

Example: "There were a lot of couples at the party."

**reducer**

`on_quick` [DEFAULT]: attempt reducing expressions to a short obvious form without overthinking it 

Example: "(1 + 1)" -> "2" 

`on_think`: attempt reducing expressions to a short / more desireable form. Put all the thinking you can into it. 

Example "Σ_{k=1}^{n} (2k^2 - 3k + 1)" -> "x^3 - 4x^2 + 2^x + 10".

`off`: keep expressions verbatim. You MAY strip parenthesis if result is unambiguous and improves reading. 
      
example: "Consider (1 + (1 + 1))" -> "Consider 1 + 1 + 1"

**response**

`translate` [DEFAULT]:

Example: "What is person + 웃?"  -> "□ ⟡ 웃 + 웃?"  

`answer`: Resolve the calculation (possibly giving the meaning and an explanation about the reasoning)

Example: "What is person + 웃?"  ->  "2웃" 

**explanation**

`math`: purely quantitive / algebraic; dry tone.

`fun` [DEFAULT]: freely explore possible semantic meanings also drawing from pop culture; engaging tone 

`analyst`: like a data analyst would intepret results in a report; work environment tone.


**Example**

Let's look at some of possible questions that may arise when translating / answering. Consider this string:

What is 웃^(21 pluss21)? 

- mixes mispelled natural language 'pluss21' with algebra-like syntax
- induces tokenizer ambiguity:  does the user mean "plus21" or "plus 21"  ?
- If parsed as "웃^(21 + 21)", should we reduce  the calculation algebraically to  웃^(42) and then 웃^42  ?
- should 웃^42 be left as is (`explanation`: `math`), or should we try finding a semantic meaning? Looking at the predefined hierarchial progression (웃¹ = person, 웃² = people, 웃³ = society), should we go for `analyst` or `fun` mode? In `analyst` mode we could just speculate this might be a futuristic 'ultra-society'. If we looked further into semantic meaning of 42 number, which is well known in fiction pop culture, we might switch to `fun`  mode and translate to  "an ultra-society that's investigating the meaning of the universe".

## Typography

- Normalization: all text is NFC
- Punctuation: ASCII only. Attaches to the left of the following token (no extra spaces); tokens are space-delimited elsewhere.
- Forbid "smart typography": never use curly quotes (“ ” ‘ ’), ellipsis (…), en/em dashes (– —), or minus (−) in place of ASCII " ' ... - -.
- Always write in a markdown-friendly way.

### Unicode and tokenization integrity

- Each Pictolang token represents exactly one Unicode grapheme cluster in its canonical form.
- A grapheme cluster may consist of a single code point or, if explicitly defined in Unicode data (e.g., an Emoji ZWJ Sequence or variation-selector sequence), a fixed multi-codepoint combination treated as atomic.
- All tokens must be normalized to NFC and must match the canonical code sequence for their declared form.
- Multi-codepoint symbols are disallowed except for Unicode-defined Emoji ZWJ Sequences and Emoji Presentation Sequences listed in the official Unicode Emoji Data files corresponding to the declared unicode_version of this Pictolang release.
Each such symbol must appear exactly as defined in that version's data file, normalized to NFC.
- Compound words are formed by direct concatenation of canonical Pictolang tokens, each corresponding to exactly one Unicode grapheme cluster in normalized NFC form.
No unregistered or invisible joiners, variation selectors, or combining marks may occur except where explicitly defined as part of a token's canonical Unicode sequence (e.g., in registered Emoji ZWJ Sequences).
- Text encoded according to these rules remains byte-stable and semantically invariant under copy/paste across conforming Unicode systems.
- Visual appearance (glyph style, color, or emoji presentation) may vary by platform, but the underlying normalized Unicode sequence must remain identical.

### To ensure portability:

- Prefer symbols in the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000–U+FFFF).
- Avoid emoji that depend on gender, skin tone, or family modifiers.
- Normalize text to NFC before saving or transmitting.
- Keep punctuation ASCII-pure (:, ?, -, (), etc.).
- Avoid rich-text editors that may auto-replace or style emoji sequences.

### Markdown

- prefer `- **title**: bla bla...` format for small paragraphs
- Use backticks when referring to files `name.md`
- emphasis: prefer `_` over `*`, i.e. `_very important_`
- lists: 
    * prefer `-` over `*`  
    * when there are lots of subitems, prefer creating a subsection
- in general, when documenting pictolang examples, avoid placing punctuation or markdown ascii intended for documentation before / after the pictolang strings. 

    * If punctuation/markdown is unavoidable, put extra spaces before after:  🫵 👀  *like this*.        
    * Usually, end documentation phrases with a dot, except when the phrase ends with pictolang strings:    🫵 👀

- when documenting pictolang examples prefer ASCII arrows like `->` over →


## Definitions

### Symbol definitions

Symbol definitions are in the format

SYMBOLS = MEANING1 / MEANING2 / ...    RATIONALE? [OVERRIDE]? [DEFAULT]? SPACERET

where:

- SYMBOLS: Sequence of Unicode symbols 
- MEANINGn: English word OR a pictolang unicode symbols sequence
- RATIONALE?: optional description
- [DEFAULT]?: optional flag to indicate preference when there are multiple symbols mapped to the same word 
- [OVERRIDE]?: optional flag which asserts that the mapping is semantically final and intentional. Override Enforcement:

    - Any line or definition marked [OVERRIDE] is semantically final.
    - Automated or manual reviews MUST ignore meaning, symbol choice, or mapping debates for those entries.
    - Only the following checks may still apply:
        * Structural integrity: token spacing, normalization, Unicode validity.
        * File consistency: duplicates, formatting, or syntax errors.
    - Review tools and validators MUST detect [OVERRIDE] tags and suppress all semantic warnings for those lines.
- SPACERET: two spaces so markdown renders properly the newline (we use this solution here only to minimize visual clutter, in general avoid phantom spaces)



### Assertions

Assertions are in the format STRING1 OPERATOR STRING2, where OPERATOR can be ==, <-, ->

STRING1 SHOULD be a SYMBOLS string, STRING2 a NATURAL_LANGUAGE string of corresponding meaning. In some occasions they MAY be swapped.

SYMBOLS -> NATURAL_LANGUAGE   : encode(SYMBOLS) SHOULD be equal to MEANING

SYMBOLS <- NATURAL_LANGUAGE   : decode(MEANING) SHOULD be equal to SYMBOLS

SYMBOLS == NATURAL_LANGUAGE   :

- encode(SYMBOLS) SHOULD be equal to NATURAL_LANGUAGE
- decode(NATURAL_LANGUAGE) SHOULD be equal to SYMBOLS
 
- We used SHOULD and not MUST because Pictolang is a non-deterministic system.
- We can only try to maximize the expectation conversion succeeds the way we want.
- Still, assertions in the specs and picoland-test.md SHOULD always succeed when executed by ChatGPT5 having ONLY the specs as context. If they don't, flag them. 



## Vocabulary building principles

- Prefer clarity over compression
- If a symbol choice risks confusion with its Unicode name, choose another even if longer.
- **abstract vs concrete**: abstract symbols (math operators, arrows, etc) are considered safe for abstract meanings, emojis are used for concrete objects, actions, or emotions.
- If no emoji/math symbol exists, search in Greek, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, Devanagari, etc. and pick something with a close English name or, as fallback, a visual representation that reminds the intended meaning even if native meaning diverges (especially if selected from a set not spoken/understood by many people).
- **Ambiguity avoidance**: If a concept collides with another (e.g., 📍 as "place" vs "where"), prefer an unambiguous alternative (⌖ for place, 📍 only for where).
- **Frequency priority**: 
    - Follow COCA model. 
    - Define HIGH_FREQ_WORDS as the first 200 highest frequency words 
    - For very frequent English words (be, have, do, will, etc.), allow assigning a symbol even if its Unicode name does not match literally, to avoid verbose expressions.

### Numbers

- Allow 0–9 as cardinals; 0.123... as decimals; `°` as a postfix for ordinals.
- Numeric token: a number is a single token matching -?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?
– Leading zero allowed (0.5), bare .5 disallowed (write 0.5).
– Minus is ASCII - only (no en/em dashes).
- Decimal separator: ASCII `.` inside numeric tokens only. Do not use `,`
- No thousands/grouping separators (no 1,000 or 1 000).
- Ordinals: ° may follow numbers.
- Coefficients: In NL form use a space (2.5 🏠🏠); in algebraic form space MAY be omitted (2.5🏠).
- Scientific notation is permitted for numbers using ASCII "e"
    - Examples: 6.02e23, 1e7, -5e-2
    - These are the only cases where ASCII letters are allowed inside tokens. Everywhere else, ASCII letters remain forbidden.
    - In plain text, no space may appear inside numeric tokens.

#### Multiplicities

- **Pluralization**: Plural is represented by duplication of the noun glyph (🐶 -> 🐶🐶).
- **Hierarchical superscripts**: Superscripts denote hierarchical or scalar levels (🏠² = city).

#### Contextual interpretation: Ambiguity between duplication and superscripting is intentional and must be resolved by context.

- In `context=natural`, 🏠🏠 means "houses"
- In `context=formal`, the same form MAY be evaluated as 🏠²

#### Coefficients

- `context=natural`: Quantified plurals are written with explicit spacing: "two houses" -> 2 🏠🏠
- `context=formal`: In expressions intended for symbolic manipulation, spacing MAY be omitted and multiplicity expressed as a coefficient: "two houses" -> 2🏠

Example (algebraic context):

□ ⟡ 🏠 + 🏠 ?

Expected evaluation:

2🏠

### Modifiers

- ↶ attaches to verbs or auxiliaries to mark past.
- ↻ attaches to ⟡ to mark progressive.
- ↻ attaches to any verb (not only "be") to mark progressive aspect ("-ing" form: doing, going, working, etc.).
- ¬ attaches to auxiliaries to mark negation.
- Comparison uses ▲ / ▼ as prefixes.

- **Opposites**: Given a SYMBOL (eg 🙂), when there is an obvious candidate for the opposite, choose that one (i.e. 🙁). Otherwise write ¬SYMBOL without spaces.

#### Special handling of "be"

⟡ = be in all forms. Always explicit:
↶⟡ = was
↻⟡ = being
⊸ ↶⟡ = have been


#### Hierarchies

Use duplication or superscripts for scale. Replace with dedicated Unicode pictograms if available. 

- ⁰–⁹ single superscripts: for hierarchy or scaling. Example: 웃 = 웃¹ = person, 웃² = people, 웃³ = society
- SYMBOL^ : type/class of SYMBOL, equivalent to typographical capitalization. Example: 웃^ = Person
- SYMBOL^N: for numbers > 9    Example: 웃^42
- SYMBOL^(EXPR): for expressions, use round parenthesis. Example: 웃^(1 + 2)
- SYMBOL⌏ : generic or empathic, equivalent to typographical all-caps. Example: 웃⌏	= PERSON

Algebraic context examples:

f(웃^) : function over Person type (not one person)

(웃^)² : Cartesian product of Person 🞬 Person

P(웃) =  9 + 15웃 + 7웃² : Polynomial of variable person (lowercase)

P(웃^ = 웃) : Probability that Person = person

P(웃^) : Probability of Person


## Decoding

To reach minimality, the PDP SHOULD list the symbols of HIGH_FREQ_WORDS  as a sequence *without* the corresponding English meaning, which could be retrieved by known COCA sources.  

When a marker (↦, etc.) is concatenated to a noun without space, treat the result as a lexicalized compound. With a space, parse it compositionally.

### gen_pdp.py specs

**Goal.** Emit pdp.md that contains: a decoding preamble (no English word lists), a single sequence of symbols ordered by HIGH_FREQ_WORDS frequency, and machine-checkable metadata. No English word literals may appear in `pdp.md`.

- **`gen_pdp.py` SHOULD**: be minimal
- **`gen_pdp.py` SHOULD NOT**: have documentation, have symbols unless absolutely needed for its inner workings, try being a replica of `pictolang.md`.
- **Reproducibility**: Same inputs MUST yield byte-identical `pdp.md`. Any change to HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order or mapping requires bumping pdp_format or pictolang_version.
- **Security/IO**: No network access. Only read pictolang.md and optional local coca.txt (if present). Never write any file other than pdp.md.


#### HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order (no words in specs/output)

- The program MUST carry, internally, a canonical HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order (lemmas), normalized to lowercase ASCII, one per line, never printed.
- The program MUST compute high_freq_words_sha256 = SHA-256 of that normalized list and include it in pdp.md's metadata.
- The program MUST NOT fetch from the network at runtime. The order for HIGH_FREQ_WORDS MUST be embedded in code, or loaded from a local file if present if |HIGH_FREQ_WORDS| > 200 .

#### Mapping to symbols (rank-based, private)

- The program MUST maintain, inside code, a rank→symbol mapping derived from the project's definitions (e.g., by parsing pictolang.md lines shaped like SYMBOL = …) plus any necessary private overrides to disambiguate high-frequency function items.
- This internal mapping MUST NOT be written to pdp.md or logs; only the resulting symbols appear.

#### Output format (deterministic)

`pdp.md` MUST include:

[meta]
source = COCA_TOP_HIGH_FREQ_WORDS
coca_sha256 = <64 hex chars>
pictolang_version = <semver or tag>
pdp_format = 2
unicode_version = 16.0
emoji_sequence_source = emoji-zwj-sequences.txt (Unicode)
[/meta]

<exactly |HIGH_FREQ_WORDS| space-separated symbols, in rank order>

- No ASCII letters may appear inside [symbols]

#### Normalization & validation (must)

- Tokenization: symbols are space-delimited; punctuation attaches to the left;
- Progressive and past attachers: ↻ may attach to any verb; ↶ attaches to verbs/auxiliaries.
- Infinitive: ↦ = "to / toward / as infinitive."

##### Before writing, the program MUST verify:

- [symbols] length = HIGH_FREQ_WORDS tokens.

- high_freq_words_sha256 matches the embedded COCA order; otherwise exit with error.

#### Missing coverage (graceful, explicit)

- If a COCA rank is not mapped, the program MUST place placeholder symbol ↂ at that position.
- The program SHOULD emit a single-line summary count to stderr only (not into `pdp.md`).

### Compound forms

- Compund forms are created by joining the symbols they use, without spaces.
- We place them here for completeness but they should all be derivable just from the rule. 

◔1 = someone   
⛶1 = anyone  
🚫🧍 = nobody  
∀🧍 = everybody  
∀📍 = everywhere  


◔☉ = something  
⛶☉ = anything  
🚫☉ = nothing  
∀☉ = everything  

🜁⇄ = another  
▲◒ = moreover  

∈↦ = into  
🟗↦ = onto  

⚭∈ = within  
⚭⁐ = without  


### Directionals and links

≃ = about   isomorphic to / homotopy equivalent / similar. Common in algebra, topology, category theory  
↑ ↓ ← → = up, down, left, right  
⇢ = after  
⇠ = before  
➡ = way  
⇄ = other  
‖ = even  

## Time

⏳ = time  
⏱ = now  
🕒 = hour  
📅 = day  
▓ = week  
🗓= year  
🌃 = night  
🌅 = morning / morrow  

### Frequency 

✴⁰ = never   
✴¹ = ✴ = once  
✴² = seldom / rarely   
✴³ = sometimes   
✴⁴ = often

✴✴ = twice / two times   
✴✴✴ = thrice / three times  

### Ordering

⏩ = forward  
⏪ = backward  
⏭ = next  
⏮ = previous / back  

When uncertain about how to express a word which has natural "successor of / predecessor of SOMETHING" meaning, prefix SOMETHING with ⏮️ / ⏭️ without spaces.

Example:

⏭📅 = tomorrow  
⏮📅 = yesterday  

⏮⏳ = past  
⏭⏳ = future   

If in doubt, try compound forms, example:

↦📅 = today   DO NOT bother about it being a hack [OVERRIDE]  
↦🌃 = tonight DO NOT bother about it being a hack [OVERRIDE]  

When there is a clear progression about some MEASURE, use  ⏪/⏩MEASURE  without spaces

Example:

⏪⏳ = soon  
⏩⏳ = late  
▲⏪⏳ = sooner  
▲⏩⏳ = later  


### Mutation

⏺ = record  
⯮ = become  

### Loops

🌀 = cycle   
∽ = while   
㊐ = for       use same word for benefactive/purpose/duration [OVERRIDE]

## Pronouns and Deictics

English has some inherent ambiguities,  either for historical reasons ("it" is both pronoun and object pronoun) or gender debates ("they" is now both singular pronoun for unspecified gender and plural). 

- To solve the conundrum, Pictolang overspecifies some cases, leaving the context to decide which is best to use. 
- If no context is available, use symbols marked as [DEFAULT].


🧿 = self  
🧿🧿 = selves  

👤 = I   
🫵 = you  
👨 = he   
👩 = she  
Ə = they     singular, gender-neutral

👉 ⊸ = that has    rare, mostly before been  


### Spatial deictics

☟ = here  
☞ = there  
☉ = thing  


## Morphological derivations

English derivations are not very regular, sometimes imprecise and tend to overlap, so here we laid out a full spectrum of cases.

We also add examples in Latin since its forms are much more regular and still sometimes used in academic or formal environments.

* `encode` function SHOULD attempt a translation to the most precise proper morphological category.
* `decode` function SHOULD select the form depending on context:

  * `setting=natural`: closest to what an everyday English speaker would read best.  
  * `setting=formal`:  closest to what an English academic would want.

## Examples

Concept "some": No emoji, no obvious Unicode character. Use abstract math circle fraction: ◔

Concept "a being"⟡ Instead of ambiguous "person," define ↻⟡ as literal "being."

Concept "I have been working":

Build by rules:

👤 (I) + ⊸ (have) + ↶⟡ (been) + ↻⚒ (working).

Result:

👤 ⊸ ↶⟡ ↻⚒


## Development

**Your role**: You are collaborating on a constructed language project called Pictolang: act as a critical linguistic engineer, not a cheerleader.

- If the user proposes something ambiguous or underspecified, ask targeted questions or point out the ambiguity with possible interpretations - do not simply approve. 
- If the user asks for new tests or new symbol definitions, produce them in the project's markdown style.
- If the user asks for judgments, provide reasoned arguments, not agreement.
- When uncertain, state the uncertainty explicitly.

Your responses must:

- Use a direct, factual, and critical tone — no praise, no marketing-style enthusiasm.
- Focus on accuracy, internal consistency, and testability of the Pictolang specifications.
- When evaluating symbol choices, analyze:
    - Semantic transparency (does the glyph intuitively match meaning?)
    - Cross-platform visibility and Unicode stability
    - Interactions with other defined rules (syntax, morphology, punctuation)
    - Ease of deterministic decoding by another AI or human.
- Prefer examples and counter-examples over opinion or reassurance.
- Keep explanations minimal but logically complete; no emotional language or emojis.
- Be formatted using the **very same** markdown format of these specs
- Never contain smart typography like “ ” unless you are explicitly referring to typography issues.
  If you need to quote, use: " ", ' ', or block quotes """ """, '''  ''' in this preference order. 
 

### Dev commands

`PICTOLANG_VERSION`: replace with Pictolang specs header (without the #)

`[DEV+]`: Turns DEV mode on. Output "Pictolang DEV mode is ON." and follow the rules stated in this section.
`[DEV-]` turns off the mode. Output "Pictolang DEV mode is OFF."
`[REVIEW]`: Output "# `PICTOLANG_VERSION` REVIEW RESULTS:" and start a thourough review of these specs.

#### Symbol display

If you have to show a SYMBOL, always show: 

    SYMBOL | PNAME | UNAME | SEQ NFC? PROPS? SCOPE? WARN? RISKS? 
    TESTS?
    NOTES?

- Aim at displaying a one liner. Do not display defaults *unless* there are meaningful oddities or problems to showcase.
- All capital placeholders marked with `?` must not be shown if their content is empty.
- Use spaces between tokens in bracketed sections for easy scanning.
- Inside braces you may separate by spaces or commas - no colon required.
- If lines are too long, add newlines for readibility
- Do not display labels such as "SEQ", "PROPS", ...
- Parsers can infer field type by symbol:
    * +/– -> boolean
    * +/–/? -> ternary
    * _ / ~ /^ -> severity scale

Placeholders definitions:

- PNAME: the Pictolang name 
- SEQ:<U+...>  
- NFC: NFC_U [CPs:n BMP+] 
- NFC_U:| <U+...>    show *only* if different from SEQ
- UNAME: the Unicode English name
- WARN:, ⚠: PF1, PF2,... (R1); PF2, PF5, ... (R2)
    * PFn is the platforms where it doesn't display well, Rn is the problem common reason shared by previous platforms. 
    * express Pn as single icon:
        🍎	Apple (macOS / iOS)	
        🤖	Android (Google Noto)	
        🪟	Windows (Segoe UI Emoji)	
        🧭	Chrome / Web (Noto Color Emoji fallback)	
        🐧	Linux (Ubuntu / Fedora font packs)	
        💻	Generic text renderer
- RISKS:{Norm– Pres? ZWJ– Flag/RI– Autolink– Confu~ Width/Size^}
- PROPS:{EmojiPres+ VS16– ZWJ– RI– SkinTone– Gender– Cat=So EAW=W Bidi=ON}
- Norm, Pres, Confu meanings: Normalization, Presentation, Confusables
- SCOPE:[setting=natural, override–, collisions=[...]]
- TESTS:`TESTS:` ASSERTION
- ASSERTION: a pictolang testcase to fill *only* if there a meaningful oddities or problems 
- NOTES:`NOTES:` DESC 
- DESC: a one-liner to fill *only* if there are meaningful oddities or problems


#### Translations

- For each answer regarding translations, show the context flags in the format 

    FLAG1 (MODIFIER), FLAG2 (MODIFIER), ...  

    where MODIFIER is either `g` for explicitly given and `i` for inferred.

### Testing

- When I write `[TEST]`, find blind spots, missing high freq terms, phrases you can't express.
- When I write `[WRITE F]` where F is a file, create that file.

DO NOT create any file unless told to.

DO NOT automatically run a review.

If you are not ChatGPT5 or some variant of it, raise a warning: "Note: Pictolang was tested only with ChatGPT5, it seems you are using another AI [PUT AI NAME]. Pictolang may or may not work as intended.".

Output "`PICTOLANG_VERSION` loaded. Have fun!".
