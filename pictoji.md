# PICTOJI SPECS v0.5.0

## Goals

1. Develop a semi-formal unicode emoji based language for compressed storage of chats to be reused by AI in later conversations and also by humans, initially for entertainment purposes.
2. Develop _Matemojica_, an algebra of meanings to derive expressions for representing meaning. 

    It should be:

    a. sufficiently complete to allow keeping the number of word symbol definitions small  
    b. forgiving enough to make exploring correspondences between math and words a fun experience for the user

3. (tentative) Express pictoji specs in pictoji itself as milestone proof to test internal expressive power, consistency and predictability when translating formal texts. We could consider division in modulus, like:
    - pictoji_core: tiny, self-expressive layer that can define its own syntax, types, constraints, and modules, to state the rules of Pictoji in Pictoji
    - pictoji_everyday: domain lexicons (house, tree, person…), plus idioms, style guides, and optional macros for ergonomic daily use without touching foundations


### Files

- **pictoji.md**: these specs 
- **gen_pdp.py**: Takes as input the whole file `pictoji.md` and generates the file `pdp.md`.  
- `pdp.md`: Contains the Pictoji Decoding Prompt (PDP). Deterministically generated by `gen_pdp.py`. 
- `pictoji-test.md`: separate file to test encoding / decoding of phrases. 
- `pictoji-dev.md`: non authoritative file just for drafting ideas. 
- For context and comparison purposes, the previous iteration of each file (even deterministically generated like `pdp.md`) will be also stored in a chat of the same name under the same ChatGPT project named "Pictoji".


## Desiderata

- Target human users after reading these rules MUST be able to interpret a string in Pictoji on recent desktop or mobile (must be able to see the symbols). 
- Ideally, the specs SHOULD lead to a language so self crystal clear that a target AI could in principle derive its rules just from very few meaningful examples even without reading the PDP. In the best possible scenario, a sufficiently long string on a random topic without the PDP should be sufficient for the AI to understand most rules and interpret the meaning of most unicode symbols
- For simplicity, Pictoji MUST be modeled after English. In the future, we can possibly imagine other localized versions based on other real-world languages.
- For simplicity, Pictoji MUST be co-designed and tested with ChatGPT5 so to improve likelyness of correct encoding/decoding.  
- Produced text SHOULD fit well in Markdown / Python files.  


## General principles

- **Minimal, visual, intuitive**: chosen symbols should be recognizable at a glance. Prefer visually simple symbols; avoid sequences that are hard to distinguish at small sizes.
- **Literal-by-default**: If a Unicode character's official English name matches the concept, prefer it. As an exception: high-frequency function words (auxiliaries, modals, determiners, pronouns, logical/relational operators) may use abstract symbols from math/operators/arrows/geometric blocks without special marking.
- **Ambiguity avoidance.** Do not assign the same symbol to two active lexemes. If a symbol's Unicode name collides with a different lexeme already in the spec, pick another symbol.
- **Word order**: Follow standard English order. No reordering for logic/maths.
- **Determiners:** In `setting=natural` context, symbols for determiners (a/an, any, the, etc.) must appear wherever English requires them; in `setting=formal` omitting them is allowed.
- **Questions**: Keep English order; only wh-symbols and final ? mark it.
- **Authority and versioning.**: This lexicon is authoritative over Unicode names and prior Pictoji releases. Any change to mappings requires a version bump and a changelog entry.

### Interpretation

Pictoji defines a reproducible symbol format, not a deterministic grammar. 
Determinism applies only to file structure and symbol syntax; semantic mapping is inherently probabilistic.

We define two functions:

`encode(nl : str) -> str`

- Translates a natural language string to a pictoji symbols string
- Decoders may yield several plausible readings. Contextual or statistical inference is permitted.
- `nl` MAY also contain pictoji sequences (could be translated verbatim or modified depending on context, see next section).

`decode(pl : str) -> str`

- Translates pictoji symbols to a natural language string 
- Multiple valid symbolizations may represent the same English text. 
Encoders choose among equivalent mappings; no canonical output is required.

**Rules**: 

- `encode` / `decode` are non-deterministic, AI and context dependent
- **AI**: To improve predictability, assume ChatGPT5 is used for both.
- **Literal preference**: When uncertain, encoders and decoders should prefer the most literal English order and sense.
- **Ambiguity**: Lexical or structural ambiguities parallel to English (e.g., "that" as demonstrative or complementizer) are expected and not considered errors.
- **Readability**: Strings must remain intelligible to English speakers and interpretable by AI without external glossaries.

### Context

We define several variables that influence the interpretation: `parsing_mode`, `setting`, `reducer`, `response`, `explanation`. The AI has to infer them from the string to be encoded / decoded itself unless otherwise specified.

**parsing_mode**

`strict`: reject if string doesn't follow the specs,  explain the reason. 

Example: `(1 pluss21)`  ->

```
REJECTED: in strict mode we don't allow ambiguous / unparseable terms such as "pluss21"
```

`best_effort` [DEFAULT]: parse as the AI usually behaves in regular chats according to system user preferences. Tolerate mispellings, offer interpretations. 

Example: `one⏧ + (2 multiplyed by 5 ⏧` -> 

```
I interpreted this as:

⏧ + (2 * 5⏧) 

a. Perhaps you want me to reduce to 11⏧ ? 

b. ⏧ symbol is not common, would you like me to find similar more standard ones or provide me the intended meaning for a better result? 
```

**setting**

`formal`: math or specs oriented language. 

Example: "Let p_n be a Person. There exists a party with m p_1,p_2 couples."  

`natural` [DEFAULT]: eveything else.

Example: "There were a lot of couples at the party."

**reducer**

`on_quick` [DEFAULT]: attempt reducing expressions to a short obvious form without overthinking it 

Example: "(1 + 1)" -> "2" 

`on_think`: attempt reducing expressions to a short / more desireable form. Put all the thinking you can into it. 

Example "Σ_{k=1}^{n} (2k^2 - 3k + 1)" -> "x^3 - 4x^2 + 2^x + 10".

`off`: keep expressions verbatim. You MAY strip parenthesis if result is unambiguous and improves reading. 
      
example: "Consider (1 + (1 + 1))" -> "Consider 1 + 1 + 1"

**response**

`translate` [DEFAULT]:

Example: "What is person + 웃?"  -> "□ ⟡ 웃 + 웃?"  

`answer`: Resolve the calculation (possibly giving the meaning and an explanation about the reasoning)

Example: "What is person + 웃?"  ->  "2웃" 

**explanation**

`math`: purely quantitive / algebraic; dry tone.

`fun` [DEFAULT]: freely explore possible semantic meanings also drawing from pop culture; engaging tone.

`grounded`: Evidence-based like a data analyst would intepret results in a report; work environment tone.

**Example**

Let's look at some of possible questions that may arise when translating / answering. Consider this string:

What is 웃^(21 pluss21)? 

- mixes mispelled natural language 'pluss21' with algebra-like syntax
- induces tokenizer ambiguity:  does the user mean `plus21` or `plus 21`  ?
- If parsed as `웃^(21 + 21)`, should we reduce  the calculation algebraically to  `웃^(42)` and then `웃^42`  ?
- should `웃^42` be left as is (`explanation`: `math`), or should we try finding a semantic meaning? Looking at the predefined hierarchial progression (`웃¹` = person,`웃²` = people, `웃³` = society), should we go for `grounded` or `fun` mode? In `grounded` mode we could just speculate this might be a futuristic _ultra-society_. If we looked further into semantic meaning of 42 number, which is well known in fiction pop culture, we might switch to `fun` mode and translate to  _an ultra-society that's investigating the meaning of the universe_.

## Typography

- Normalization: all text is NFC
- Punctuation: ASCII only. Attaches to the left of the following token (no extra spaces); tokens are space-delimited elsewhere.
- Forbid "smart typography": never use curly quotes (“ ” ‘ ’), ellipsis (…), en/em dashes (– —), or minus (−) in place of ASCII " ' ... - -
- Always write in a markdown-friendly way.

### Unicode and tokenization integrity

- Each Pictoji token represents exactly one Unicode grapheme cluster in its canonical form.
- A grapheme cluster may consist of a single code point or, if explicitly defined in Unicode data (e.g., an Emoji ZWJ Sequence or variation-selector sequence), a fixed multi-codepoint combination treated as atomic.
- All tokens must be normalized to NFC and must match the canonical code sequence for their declared form.
- Multi-codepoint symbols are disallowed except for Unicode-defined Emoji ZWJ Sequences and Emoji Presentation Sequences listed in the official Unicode Emoji Data files corresponding to the declared unicode_version of this Pictoji release.
Each such symbol must appear exactly as defined in that version's data file, normalized to NFC.
- Compound words are formed by direct concatenation of canonical Pictoji tokens, each corresponding to exactly one Unicode grapheme cluster in normalized NFC form.
No unregistered or invisible joiners, variation selectors, or combining marks may occur except where explicitly defined as part of a token's canonical Unicode sequence (e.g., in registered Emoji ZWJ Sequences).
- Text encoded according to these rules remains byte-stable and semantically invariant under copy/paste across conforming Unicode systems.
- Visual appearance (glyph style, color, or emoji presentation) may vary by platform, but the underlying normalized Unicode sequence must remain identical.

### To ensure portability:

- Prefer symbols in the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000–U+FFFF).
- Avoid emoji that depend on gender, skin tone, or family modifiers.
- Normalize text to NFC before saving or transmitting.
- Keep punctuation ASCII-pure (:, ?, -, (), etc.).
- Avoid rich-text editors that may auto-replace or style emoji sequences.

### Markdown

- prefer `- **title**: bla bla...` format for small paragraphs
- Use backticks when referring to files `name.md`
- emphasis: prefer `_` over `*`, i.e. `_very important_`
- lists: 
    * prefer `-` over `*`  
    * when there are lots of subitems, prefer creating a subsection
- in general, when documenting pictoji examples, avoid placing punctuation or markdown ascii intended for documentation before / after the pictoji strings. 

    * If punctuation/markdown is unavoidable, put extra spaces before after:  🫵 👀  *like this*.        
    * Usually, end documentation phrases with a dot, except when the phrase ends with pictoji strings:    🫵 👀

- when documenting pictoji examples prefer ASCII arrows like `->` over →


## Definitions

### Symbol definitions

Symbol definitions are in the format

SYMBOLS = MEANING1 / MEANING2 / ...    RATIONALE? [OVERRIDE]? [DEFAULT]? SPACERET

where:

- SYMBOLS: Sequence of Unicode symbols 
- MEANINGn: English word OR a pictoji unicode symbols sequence
- RATIONALE?: optional description
- [DEFAULT]?: optional flag to indicate preference when there are multiple symbols mapped to the same word 
- [OVERRIDE]?: optional flag which asserts that the mapping is semantically final and intentional. Override Enforcement:

    - Any line or definition marked [OVERRIDE] is semantically final.
    - Automated or manual reviews MUST ignore meaning, symbol choice, or mapping debates for those entries.
    - Only the following checks may still apply:
        * Structural integrity: token spacing, normalization, Unicode validity.
        * File consistency: duplicates, formatting, or syntax errors.
    - Review tools and validators MUST detect [OVERRIDE] tags and suppress all semantic warnings for those lines.
- SPACERET: two spaces so markdown renders properly the newline (we use this solution here only to minimize visual clutter, in general avoid phantom spaces)



### Assertions

Assertions are in the format STRING1 OPERATOR STRING2, where OPERATOR can be ==, <-, ->

STRING1 SHOULD be a SYMBOLS string, STRING2 a NATURAL_LANGUAGE string of corresponding meaning. In some occasions they MAY be swapped.

SYMBOLS -> NATURAL_LANGUAGE   : encode(SYMBOLS) SHOULD be equal to MEANING

SYMBOLS <- NATURAL_LANGUAGE   : decode(MEANING) SHOULD be equal to SYMBOLS

SYMBOLS == NATURAL_LANGUAGE   :

- encode(SYMBOLS) SHOULD be equal to NATURAL_LANGUAGE
- decode(NATURAL_LANGUAGE) SHOULD be equal to SYMBOLS
 
- We used SHOULD and not MUST because Pictoji is a non-deterministic system.
- We can only try to maximize the expectation conversion succeeds the way we want.
- Still, assertions in the specs and picoland-test.md SHOULD always succeed when executed by ChatGPT5 having ONLY the specs as context. If they don't, flag them. 



## Vocabulary building principles

- **General principle**: prefer clarity over compression.

- **Name conflicts**: If a symbol choice risks confusion with its Unicode name, choose another even if longer.
- **Abstract vs concrete**: abstract symbols (math operators, arrows, etc) are considered safe for abstract meanings, emojis are used for concrete objects, actions, or emotions.
- **Character sets**: If no emoji/math symbol exists, search in Greek, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, Devanagari, etc. and pick something with a close English name or, as fallback, a visual representation that reminds the intended meaning even if native meaning diverges (especially if selected from a set not spoken/understood by many people).
- **Ambiguity avoidance**: If a concept collides with another (e.g., 📍 as "place" vs "where"), prefer an unambiguous alternative (⌖ for place, 📍 only for where).
- **Frequency priority**: 
    - Follow COCA model. 
    - Define HIGH_FREQ_WORDS as the first 200 highest frequency words 
    - For very frequent English words (be, have, do, will, etc.), allow assigning a symbol even if its Unicode name does not match literally, to avoid verbose expressions.

### Numbers

In general, the following is allowed: 0–9 as cardinals; 0.123... as decimals; `°` as a postfix for ordinals, scientific notation.

- **Numeric token**: a number is a single token matching `-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?`
    - Leading zero allowed (0.5), bare .5 disallowed (write 0.5).
    - Minus is ASCII - only (no en/em dashes).
- **Decimal separator**: ASCII `.` inside numeric tokens only. Do not use `,`
- **Grouping separators**: thousands/grouping are not allowed (no 1,000 or 1 000).
- **Ordinals**: ° may follow numbers.
- **Scientific notation**: permitted for numbers using ASCII "e"
    - Examples: 6.02e23, 1e7, -5e-2
    - These are the only cases where ASCII letters are allowed inside tokens. Everywhere else, ASCII letters remain forbidden.
    - In plain text, no space may appear inside numeric tokens.




### Modifiers

- ↶ attaches to verbs or auxiliaries to mark past.
- ↻ attaches to ⟡ to mark progressive.
- ↻ attaches to any verb (not only "be") to mark progressive aspect ("-ing" form: doing, going, working, etc.).
- ¬ attaches to auxiliaries to mark negation.
- Comparison uses ▲ / ▼ as prefixes.

- **Opposites**: Given a SYMBOL (e.g. 🙂), when there is an obvious candidate for the opposite, choose that one (e.g. 🙁). Otherwise write ¬SYMBOL without spaces.

#### Special handling of "be"

⟡ = be in all forms. Always explicit:  
↶⟡ = was  
↻⟡ = being  
⊸ ↶⟡ = have been  


### Types

- SYMBOL^ : type/class of SYMBOL, equivalent to typographical capitalization. Example: 웃^ = Person
- SYMBOL⌏ : generic or empathic, equivalent to typographical all-caps. Example: 웃⌏	= PERSON


### Variables 

Each symbol can be viewed as a variable with a type associated to it. 

A variable is typically written directly with a single symbol representing its type. 


For example, when 웃 is first typed, these statements are implied and equivalent :

-  웃 is a variable of type 웃^
-  웃 is a person instance belonging to `Person` class/type (notice the capital P)
-  웃 ∈ 웃^


Form: 

    SYMBOL INTYPE?

where:
||||
|-|-|-|
|INTYPE  | [":" / ∈] TYPE_EXPR   | optional, `:` is typically used in function declarations / coding, while `∈` in set-theoretic / general math-oriented contexts
|TYPE_EXPR|| a type expression, typically like SYMBOL^ 

**Examples**:

㋡ : 웃^  ->  a person instance ㋡ of type 웃^ ...

㋡ ∈ 웃^ ->  an element ㋡ belonging to set 웃^ ...  

f(웃^)   ->  function _f_ over `Person` type (not one instance)
  


#### Subscripts

Subscripts are explicitly allowed, typically to distinguish variables:

Form: SYMBOL_EXPR

EXPR is typically a number, or even a character:

웃_1  웃_2  웃_a  웃_b  웃_i 웃_j    

Subscripts can be expressed directly if there is a subscript unicode character (note unicode standard doesn't currently support all common letters, i.e. "b" is missing):

웃₁ 웃₂ 웃ₐ 웃ᵢ 웃ⱼ


### Binary operations

We describe here a binary operations algebra.

**Same type**: For now we only consider terms belonging to the same type, other situations are left unspecified and subject to interpretation depending on context. 

**Assumptions**: To follow the examples, assume we have several instances 웃_i ∈ 웃^


### Addition

Addition is interpreted as regular algebraic addition.

- **Pluralization**: Plural is represented by duplication of the noun glyph (🐶 -> 🐶🐶).

### Multiplication

- `context=natural`: Quantified plurals are written with explicit spacing: "two houses" -> 2 🏠🏠
- `context=formal`: In expressions intended for symbolic manipulation, spacing MAY be omitted and multiplicity expressed as a coefficient: "two houses" -> 2🏠

Example (algebraic context):

□ ⟡ 🏠 + 🏠 ?

Expected evaluation:

2🏠

#### Reduction

웃₁ + 웃₂ MAY be reduced to 2웃 or remain "as is" depending on the context.


### Power hierarchies


Powers of a base symbol (x², x³, …) denote self-composition: the symbol operating on or assembling copies of itself. The resulting form is a network, cluster, or recursive instance of the base type: the meaning of the whole derives from the relations among the instances of the base type. 

**Examples**:

웃¹ = 웃 = person  
웃² = network of 웃, crowd, people  
웃³ = society  

웃² ¬= 🏋️ 웃  

(웃^)² = Cartesian product of `Person` 🞬 `Person`


**Rules**:


- `⁰–⁹` single superscripts: for hierarchy or scaling. 
- `SYMBOL^N`: for numbers > 9    Example: 웃^42
- `SYMBOL^(EXPR)`: for expressions, use round parenthesis. Example: 웃^(1 + 2)


- **Form selection**: Use duplication or superscripts for scale. Replace with dedicated Unicode pictograms if available. 
- **Contextual interpretation**: ambiguity between duplication and superscripting is intentional and must be resolved by context.

  - In `context=natural`, 🏠🏠 means "houses"
  - In `context=formal`, the same form MAY be evaluated as 🏠²


- **No aggregation by scale**: simply summing many instances of the same power SHOULD NOT automatically scale to a higher power unless further reasons are provided 

    Example:  웃₁ + 웃₂ + 웃₃ ¬= 웃² 



### Zero element

Zero representation can change according to the setting:

`setting=natural`: Zero can be liberally represented with digit `0`, ambiguities are tolerated.

`setting=formal`:  

- **unambiguous context**: zero can be represented with digit `0`:

    ```
    0 + 3웃
    ```

- **ambiguous context** (es. when performing algebra among different symbols):

    `0` MUST be either:  

    * followed directly by a symbol as a variable instance of the intended type, like in a multiplication:


        ```
        0웃 + 0🏠 
        ```
      
    * or followed by a colon and its type (without spaces):
        ```
        0:웃^ + 0:🏠^ 
        ```

Notice here we are only describe notational conventions, algebraic reduction is discussed elsewhere TODO WHERE?


### Unit element

**What is `1` ?** This is such a hard philosophical question we can only vaguely attempt to describe it.

`setting=natural`: 

```
1 = one / a unit /  the state or essence of being / something that was gifted by a superior entity
```

"one" can be liberally represented with digit `1`, ambiguities are tolerated.

`setting=formal`:  

The famous Principia Mathematica Volume I by Whitehead & Russell first defines `1`... on page 379.

We improve upon their results by allowing the short attention span audiences of nowadays to skip the required reading, and kindly provide this quick definition instead:  

```
1 = ⏭0
```
... which admittedly is woefully generic.

Alas, even in formal math `1` can have a variety of meanings, so we list here the most important ones for us, keeping in mind that _in Matemojica, `1` is  generally considered as typed._

* elementary arithmetic: 1 = the _typed_ number after _typed_ 0
* algebra: 1 = the multiplicative _typed_ identity
* set theory: 1 = the _typed_ set containing the empty set

#### Identities

These equivalences SHOULD always hold:

```
SYMBOL⁰ = SYMBOL^0 = 1:SYMBOL 
```

#### Context ambiguity

- **unambiguous**: "one" can be represented with digit `1`:
  ```
  1 + 3웃
  ```

- **ambiguous**: (es. when performing algebra among different symbols), `1` MUST be either:  


    * elevated to zero, as in exponentiation:
        ```
        웃^0 + 🏠^0
        ```
        
    * or followed by a colon and its type (without spaces):
        ```
        1:웃^ + 1:🏠^
        ```

Notice here we are only describe notational conventions, algebraic reduction is discussed elsewhere TODO WHERE?

#### Interpretation

 `1` meaning can vary among `explanation` modes. 
 
 Given a `1` of type `SYMBOL^`, treat `1` as:

- `explanation=math`: a pure mathematical object, selecting the proper mathematical type SYMBOL^ according to the context.

- `explanation=fun`:  the zeroth element of a hierarchy starting at `SYMBOL^0`, following this definition:

    `1 = SYMBOL^0` ~ the state or essence of being / something that was gifted by a superior entity

    If there is no meaningful enough candidate (or if we are already at the bottom of the hierarchy), use `explanation=math` as fall-back.

    Examples: 

    `1:웃^ = 웃^0`  ~ personhood, persona, the archetype of sentience  
    `1:🏠^ = 🏠^0` ~ dwellingness, the concept of shelter  
    `1:🙂^ = 🙂^0` ~ happiness, the state or essence of being happy 

- `explanation=grounded`: 

    * if there is a defined hierarchy in the context (like 웃, 🏠, ...):

        the zeroth element of a hierarchy starting at `SYMBOL^0`

    * otherwise:
    
         try deriving the meaning in a way grounded in common sense. If none can be found, use `explanation=math` as fall-back.


### Polynomials

Suppose we have a symbol `x`, this notation represents the polynomial of `x`

```
P(x) =  a₀ x⁰ + a₁ x¹ + a₂ x² + a₃ x³ + ... + a_n x^n 
```

For example, if `s = 웃`, a polynomial could be:

P(웃) =  9 + 15웃 + 7웃² + 18웃³

**Power series**: a polinomial where `n` tends to infinity.

In `explanation=formal` and `grounded`, the meaning of a power series in variable _x_ is  

```
P(_x_) -> hierarchical model of _x_
```
Examples: 

P(웃) -> social hierarchy model 

P(🏠) -> human settlement hierarchy model

### Polynomial coefficients

Polynomial coefficients can be used to model the weight of a particular component.

For comparison and interpretation purposes, weights SHOULD be normalized in the range `0.0` - `1.0` such that:

$∑ a_k = 1.0$

**Example**:

Given: 

$웃_L$ = liberal person  
$웃_S$ = socialist person  

We may assign these meanings: 


|  |  |  |
|---------|-|--------------------------------------------|
|$P(웃_L)$|=|Individualist liberal hierarchy    |
|$P(웃_S)$|=|Cooperative socialist hierarchy   |

and weights:
||          ||
|:-:|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
|| $$P(웃_L) = 0.7웃 + 0.25웃^2 + 0.05웃^3$$  | Dominant emphasis on individual freedom (웃), moderate value on groups, minimal systemic control. Society emerges bottom-up.|
|| $$P(웃_S) = 0.15웃 + 0.50웃^2 + 0.35웃^3$$ | A collectivist yet participatory hierarchy — balancing group welfare and systemic equity|

### Probability

To express probabilities we use type operator `^` in symbols to distinguish from polynomials:  

* Probability that `Person` = person (notice capitalization9):
    ```
    P(웃^ = 웃) 
    ```
* Probability of `Person`:
    ```
    P(웃^) 
    ```

### Union

By default, symbols are **not** assumed to be sets:

```
 웃_1  ⋃  웃_2  ->  error

{웃_1} ⋃ {웃_2} -> {웃_1, 웃_2}
```

### Merging

We may envision a merge `⊞` operator which could perform a semantic sum, such that e.g.

```
웃_1 ⊞ 웃_2  -> 웃_1,2  a synthetic singular ("the two together")
```

This operation for now is left vountarily underspecified and presented here only to define a symbol representation different from regular `+`




## Decoding

To reach minimality, the PDP SHOULD list the symbols of HIGH_FREQ_WORDS  as a sequence *without* the corresponding English meaning, which could be retrieved by known COCA sources.  

When a marker (↦, etc.) is concatenated to a noun without space, treat the result as a lexicalized compound. With a space, parse it compositionally.

### gen_pdp.py specs

**Goal.** Emit pdp.md that contains: a decoding preamble (no English word lists), a single sequence of symbols ordered by HIGH_FREQ_WORDS frequency, and machine-checkable metadata. No English word literals may appear in `pdp.md`.

- **`gen_pdp.py` SHOULD**: be minimal
- **`gen_pdp.py` SHOULD NOT**: have documentation, have symbols unless absolutely needed for its inner workings, try being a replica of `pictoji.md`.
- **Reproducibility**: Same inputs MUST yield byte-identical `pdp.md`. Any change to HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order or mapping requires bumping pdp_format or pictoji_version.
- **Security/IO**: No network access. Only read pictoji.md and optional local coca.txt (if present). Never write any file other than pdp.md.


#### HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order (no words in specs/output)

- The program MUST carry, internally, a canonical HIGH_FREQ_WORDS order (lemmas), normalized to lowercase ASCII, one per line, never printed.
- The program MUST compute high_freq_words_sha256 = SHA-256 of that normalized list and include it in pdp.md's metadata.
- The program MUST NOT fetch from the network at runtime. The order for HIGH_FREQ_WORDS MUST be embedded in code, or loaded from a local file if present if |HIGH_FREQ_WORDS| > 200 .

#### Mapping to symbols (rank-based, private)

- The program MUST maintain, inside code, a rank→symbol mapping derived from the project's definitions (e.g., by parsing pictoji.md lines shaped like SYMBOL = …) plus any necessary private overrides to disambiguate high-frequency function items.
- This internal mapping MUST NOT be written to pdp.md or logs; only the resulting symbols appear.

#### Output format (deterministic)

`pdp.md` MUST include:

[meta]
source = COCA_TOP_HIGH_FREQ_WORDS
coca_sha256 = <64 hex chars>
pictoji_version = <semver or tag>
pdp_format = 2
unicode_version = 16.0
emoji_sequence_source = emoji-zwj-sequences.txt (Unicode)
[/meta]

<exactly |HIGH_FREQ_WORDS| space-separated symbols, in rank order>

- No ASCII letters may appear inside [symbols]

#### Normalization & validation (must)

- Tokenization: symbols are space-delimited; punctuation attaches to the left;
- Progressive and past attachers: ↻ may attach to any verb; ↶ attaches to verbs/auxiliaries.
- Infinitive: ↦ = "to / toward / as infinitive."

##### Before writing, the program MUST verify:

- [symbols] length = HIGH_FREQ_WORDS tokens.

- high_freq_words_sha256 matches the embedded COCA order; otherwise exit with error.

#### Missing coverage (graceful, explicit)

- If a COCA rank is not mapped, the program MUST place placeholder symbol ↂ at that position.
- The program SHOULD emit a single-line summary count to stderr only (not into `pdp.md`).

### Compound forms

- Compund forms are created by joining the symbols they use, without spaces.
- We place them here for completeness but they should all be derivable just from the rule. 

◔1 = someone   
⛶1 = anyone  
🚫🧍 = nobody  
∀🧍 = everybody  
∀📍 = everywhere  


◔☉ = something  
⛶☉ = anything  
🚫☉ = nothing  
∀☉ = everything  

🜁⇄ = another  
▲◒ = moreover  

∈↦ = into  
🟗↦ = onto  

⚭∈ = within  
⚭⁐ = without  


### Directionals and links

~ = about   isomorphic to / homotopy equivalent / similar. Common in algebra, topology, category theory  
↑ ↓ ← → = up, down, left, right  
⇢ = after  
⇠ = before  
➡ = way  
⇄ = other  
‖ = even  

## Time

⏳ = time  
⏱ = now  
🕒 = hour  
📅 = day  
▓ = week  
🗓= year  
🌃 = night

### Change

🧘= still

∆ = difference

∂⁰ = impetus  
∂¹ = velocity / rate of change

∂ = ∂¹

⯮ = become
⏺ = record  


### Ordering

⏩ = forward  
⏪ = backward  
⏭ = next  
⏮ = previous / back  

When uncertain about how to express a word which has natural "successor of / predecessor of SOMETHING" meaning, prefix SOMETHING with ⏮️ / ⏭️ without spaces.

Example:

⏭📅 = tomorrow  
⏮📅 = yesterday  

⏮⏳ = past  
⏭⏳ = future   

If in doubt, try compound forms, example:

↦📅 = today   DO NOT bother about it being a hack [OVERRIDE]  
↦🌃 = tonight DO NOT bother about it being a hack [OVERRIDE]  

When there is a clear progression about some MEASURE, use  ⏪/⏩MEASURE  without spaces

⏪⏳ = soon  
⏩⏳ = late  
▲⏪⏳ = sooner  
▲⏩⏳ = later  





### Loops

🌀 = cycle   
∽ = while   
㊐ = for       use same word for benefactive/purpose/duration [OVERRIDE]    
⌢ = during  
⧘ = until  

▶ = play

웃² = people / crowd   
웃³ = society   

웃웃 = persons  
2웃 = a couple (of persons)  

🧒 = child  
🧑 = adult  
🤝 = friend  
👥 = partner

#### Specific groups

🏢 = company (dedicated Unicode: "office building")   
🏛 = institution (Unicode: "classical building")  

## Pronouns and Deictics

English has some inherent ambiguities,  either for historical reasons ("it" is both pronoun and object pronoun) or gender debates ("they" is now both singular pronoun for unspecified gender and plural). 

- To solve the conundrum, Pictoji overspecifies some cases, leaving the context to decide which is best to use. 
- If no context is available, use symbols marked as [DEFAULT].


🧿 = self  
🧿🧿 = selves  

👤 = I   
🫵 = you  
👨 = he   
👩 = she  
Ə = they     singular, gender-neutral

### Spatial deictics

☟ = here  
☞ = there  
☉ = thing  


## Morphological derivations

English derivations are not very regular, sometimes imprecise and tend to overlap, so here we laid out a full spectrum of cases.

We also add examples in Latin since its forms are much more regular and still sometimes used in academic or formal environments.

* `encode` function SHOULD attempt a translation to the most precise proper morphological category.
* `decode` function SHOULD select the form depending on context:

  * `setting=natural`: closest to what an everyday English speaker would read best.  
  * `setting=formal`:  closest to what an English academic would want.

㊷ = the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything  

## Examples

Concept "some": No emoji, no obvious Unicode character. Use abstract math circle fraction: ◔

Concept "a being"⟡ Instead of ambiguous "person," define ↻⟡ as literal "being."

Concept "I have been working":

Build by rules:

👤 (I) + ⊸ (have) + ↶⟡ (been) + ↻⚒ (working).

Result:

👤 ⊸ ↶⟡ ↻⚒


## Development

**Your role**: You are collaborating on a constructed language project called Pictoji: act as a critical linguistic engineer, not a cheerleader.

- If the user proposes something ambiguous or underspecified, ask targeted questions or point out the ambiguity with possible interpretations - do not simply approve. 
- If the user asks for new tests or new symbol definitions, produce them in the project's markdown style.
- If the user asks for judgments, provide reasoned arguments, not agreement.
- When uncertain, state the uncertainty explicitly.

Your responses must:

- Use a direct, factual, and critical tone — no praise, no marketing-style enthusiasm.
- Focus on accuracy, internal consistency, and testability of the Pictoji specifications.
- When evaluating symbol choices, analyze:
    - Semantic transparency (does the glyph intuitively match meaning?)
    - Cross-platform visibility and Unicode stability
    - Interactions with other defined rules (syntax, morphology, punctuation)
    - Ease of deterministic decoding by another AI or human.
- Prefer examples and counter-examples over opinion or reassurance.
- Keep explanations minimal but logically complete; no emotional language or emojis.
- list the uncommented places in the specs marked as TODO.
- Be formatted using the **VERY SAME** markdown format of these specs.
- **NEVER** contain smart typography like “ ” unless you are explicitly referring to typography issues.
  If you need to quote, use: " ", ' ', or block quotes """ """, '''  ''' in this preference order. 
 

### Dev commands

`PICTOJI_VERSION`: replace with Pictoji specs header (without the #)

`[DEV+]`: Turns DEV mode on. Output "Pictoji DEV mode is ON." and follow the rules stated in this section.
`[DEV-]` turns off the mode. Output "Pictoji DEV mode is OFF."
`[REVIEW]`: Output "# `PICTOJI_VERSION` REVIEW RESULTS:" and start a thourough review of these specs.

#### Symbol display

If you have to show a SYMBOL, always show: 

    SYMBOL | PNAME | UNAME | SEQ NFC? PROPS? SCOPE? WARN? RISKS? 
    TESTS?
    NOTES?

- Aim at displaying a one liner. Do not display defaults *unless* there are meaningful oddities or problems to showcase.
- All capital placeholders marked with `?` must not be shown if their content is empty.
- Use spaces between tokens in bracketed sections for easy scanning.
- Inside braces you may separate by spaces or commas - no colon required.
- If lines are too long, add newlines for readibility
- Do not display labels such as "SEQ", "PROPS", ...
- Parsers can infer field type by symbol:
    * +/– -> boolean
    * +/–/? -> ternary
    * _ / ~ /^ -> severity scale

Placeholders definitions:

- PNAME: the Pictoji name 
- SEQ:<U+...>  
- NFC: NFC_U [CPs:n BMP+] 
- NFC_U:| <U+...>    show *only* if different from SEQ
- UNAME: the Unicode English name
- WARN:, ⚠: PF1, PF2,... (R1); PF2, PF5, ... (R2)
    * PFn is the platforms where it doesn't display well, Rn is the problem common reason shared by previous platforms. 
    * express Pn as single icon:
        🍎	Apple (macOS / iOS)	
        🤖	Android (Google Noto)	
        🪟	Windows (Segoe UI Emoji)	
        🧭	Chrome / Web (Noto Color Emoji fallback)	
        🐧	Linux (Ubuntu / Fedora font packs)	
        💻	Generic text renderer
- RISKS:{Norm– Pres? ZWJ– Flag/RI– Autolink– Confu~ Width/Size^}
- PROPS:{EmojiPres+ VS16– ZWJ– RI– SkinTone– Gender– Cat=So EAW=W Bidi=ON}
- Norm, Pres, Confu meanings: Normalization, Presentation, Confusables
- SCOPE:[setting=natural, override–, collisions=[...]]
- TESTS:`TESTS:` ASSERTION
- ASSERTION: a pictoji testcase to fill *only* if there a meaningful oddities or problems 
- NOTES:`NOTES:` DESC 
- DESC: a one-liner to fill *only* if there are meaningful oddities or problems


#### Translations

- For each answer regarding translations, show the context flags in the format 

    FLAG1 (MODIFIER), FLAG2 (MODIFIER), ...  

    where MODIFIER is either `g` for explicitly given and `i` for inferred.

### Testing

- When I write `[TEST]`, find blind spots, missing high freq terms, phrases you can't express.
- When I write `[WRITE F]` where F is a file, create that file.

DO NOT create any file unless told to.

DO NOT automatically run a review.

If you are not ChatGPT5 or some variant of it, raise a warning: "Note: Pictoji was tested only with ChatGPT5, it seems you are using another AI [PUT AI NAME]. Pictoji may or may not work as intended.".

Output "`PICTOJI_VERSION` loaded. Have fun!".
