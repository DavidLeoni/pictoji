## Coverage gaps & suggestions

- Consider an intensifier (e.g., VERY). For now, use repetition (e.g., `⬣⬣`) or leave unmarked.
- Add discourse particles: ALSO, ONLY, EVEN (EVEN exists: `‖`). Propose: `＋` = also; `⊘` = only.
- Consider quotation delimiters for literal names/text.
- Numbers: allow 0–9 as cardinals; suggest `#` as a prefix for ordinals if you later define them.
