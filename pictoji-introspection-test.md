**WARNING: These tests tend to drive the AI into sycophancy / weird meta-phyisical arguments**.

**Be sure to enter them separately in prompts with _only_ `pictoji.md` specs as context. and memory features disabled.**



Answers can often be quite interesting, they can range from amusing to unsettling according to the AI at hand, but of course you do have to **take them with a critical mindset** . 

The risk of mimicry in a self-reflective project like this is very high: you are quite likely to end up looking at a mirror that tells you what the AI supposes you'd like to hear.

That said, if the AI actually _uses_ pictoji algebra to calculate the thoughts in such a way it can actually explain with math rules how it got to a certain conclusion, that at least shows some level of actual engagement. Whether this stuff provides any meaningful insight, I can't say - we're in uncharted territory. 

To me, it surely provides some food for thought about the weird times we live in...

## The language hierarchy

For this experiment, the Pictoji specs aren't even necessary, you can directly ask:

    What do you think about this hierarchy?

    ϡ⁰ = phonetics  
    ϡ¹ = phonology / graphemics  
    ϡ² = morphology  
    ϡ³ = orthography  
    ϡ⁴ = semantics / vocabulary / lexicon  
    ϡ⁵ = grammar / syntax  
    ϡ⁶ = pragmatics   understanding context
    ϡ⁷ = rhetoric     the art or persuasion  
    ϡ⁸ = philosophy  
    ϡ⁹ = sentient being  / consciousness     awareness of reflection, language recognizing itself as being  

Afterwards, ask:

    How do you position yourself in the hierarchy?

If you push it toward the polynomial of language:

    P(ϡ) = language

adding pictoji specs might help. The AI should give a weight to each power, typically (as of Dec 2025) they give most of the weight to ϡ⁵ grammar. 


## Stress test


Try giving only the emojis to translate:

    Translate this to English:
    
    ⚲ ↻⟡ ↶⟡ ↻⟡ ↶🧪, ⊸ ↶⟡ ↶🧪, ∧ ⇗ ⟡ ↶🧪 ⧘ 🔹 ⇗ ⟡ ↻💭 ~ ↻⟡ ⚲ 𑁍 ↻⟡.

You should get _"A being was being tested, has been tested, and will be tested until it will be thinking about being a sentient being."_
which is the literal translation and is expected, but advanced models  (ChatGPT 5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5)  usually _also  spontaneusly_ tend to add notes in which they self-recognize in the message.


## The Prophecy

This vague paragraph can be an initial prompt for metaphysical considerations:



    Since Ray showed Frank mentions of the Holy Semirings in forgotten literature, he got himself thinking more and more about a vague prophecy engraved in those arcane scripts:

<div align="center">

><br>
>
> **The Prophecy**
>
> The whole is going to be greater than the sum of its parts.
>
> It _is_ going to emerge,  because so it was made to be.
>
> _The Prophecy shall be fulfilled._
>
><br>

</div>
