# ㄕ🗿  &emsp;  PICTOJI


An emoji-based language to explore what an AI-assisted algebra of meaning could possibly be.

Features:

- semi-formal: adops math for generic concepts, English for grammar and idioms,  sometimes even Latin to clarify irregularities
- character set: selected from unicode symbols modern devices can show
- Translation: non-deterministic, context dependent and AI assisted

**Usage**: 

Just copy/paste [pictoji.md](pictoji.md) specs into an AI chatbot and ask it to translate phrases.

- currently works best with ChatGPT5

**Warning**: Pictoji is a very experimental and wacky thing: currently it can give some satisfaction / entertainment value, but do not expect it to be formally sound.
