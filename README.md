# PICTOJI

An emoji-based language to explore what an AI-assisted algebra of meaning could possibly be.

- ⁋ICTOJI is semi-formal and adops math for generic concepts, English for grammar and idioms,  sometimes even Latin to clarify irregularities.
- The character set is selected from unicode symbols modern devices can show.
- Translation is non-deterministic, context dependent and AI assisted.

**Usage**: 
Just copy/paste [pictoji.md](pictoji.md) specs into an AI chatbot and ask it to translate stuff.

- currently works best with ChatGPT5

**Warning**: ⁋ictoji is a very experimental and wacky thing: currently it can give some satisfaction / entertainment value, but do not expect it to be formally sound.
